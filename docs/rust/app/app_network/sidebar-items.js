initSidebarItems({"fn":[["send_sensor_data","Compose a CoAP JSON message with the Sensor Key (field name) and Value in `val` and send to the CoAP server.  The message will be enqueued for transmission by the CoAP / OIC  Background Task so this function will return without waiting for the message to be transmitted. Return `Ok()` if successful, `SYS_EAGAIN` if network is not ready yet. For the CoAP server hosted at thethings.io, the CoAP payload should be encoded in JSON like this: `json {\"values\":[   {\"key\":\"device\", \"value\":\"0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f10\"},   {\"key\":\"t\",      \"value\":1715} ]} `"]]});
